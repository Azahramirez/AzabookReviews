### 2025

- Greener Than You Think (1947) *In Progress*

### 2024

- **Jurassic Park (1990)**
  Great book, a little bit more violent than the movie, would recommend if you are fan of the series, but it certainly has a weird pace at the end compared to the beginning where Crichton really took his time to explain all the details of this marvelous world
- **1984 (1949)**
  Set on a dystopian England with a lot of ressemblance to the modern survelliance, which is wild to be this closed considering that Orwell wrote this at the end of WW2, so I would say the atmosphere surrounding the characters is the protagonist of the whole novel, but the ending is one of the best monologues about freedom in the 20th century.

### 2023

- **Prey (2002)**
  This story made me think Crichton is one of the best sci-fi writers on recent years, his attention to detail is amazing and the pacing all throughout the book is just esplendid, I guess the most interesting part to me was the intelligent swarm dilema, given that it could be a possibility on the next few years

### 2022

- **The analyst 1,2,3**
